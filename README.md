# Digital e-Parking System

## Project Overview
The Digital e-Parking System is a C++ based application designed to manage parking slots efficiently. The program interacts with a file (`save.txt`) to store and retrieve the status of parking slots, allowing for the entry and exit of vehicles. The system is designed to handle 40 parking slots and keeps track of which slots are occupied and which are available.

## Features
- **Slot Status Display**: Displays the status of all 40 parking slots, showing whether each slot is available ('A') or not ('N').
- **Entry Management**: Allocates the first available parking slot to an incoming vehicle.
- **Exit Management**: Frees up a parking slot when a vehicle leaves, making it available for future use.

## How It Works
1. **File Handling**: The program opens a file named `save.txt` in read/write mode. For the first time it creates new file called sve.txt later it utilises the same file only.
2. **Displaying Slot Status**: The status of each slot is read from the file and displayed to the user. Slots marked with '0' are available, and slots marked with '1' are occupied.
3. **User Interaction**:
   - **Entry**: The user can select the "Entry" option, which allocates the first available slot to the vehicle.
   - **Exit**: The user can select the "Exit" option, which frees up a specified slot.
4. **File Update**: After every entry or exit operation, the file is updated with the new status of the parking slots.

## Requirements
- **C++**: The code is written in C++ and uses standard libraries such as `<iostream>` and `<iomanip>`.
- **File `save.txt`**: A text file that stores the status of the parking slots. This file must be present in the working directory.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Compile and Run**: Compile the program using a C++ compiler and run the executable.
2. **Initial Setup**: Ensure that `save.txt` exists with the correct format. Each slot should be initialized with '0' for available or '1' for occupied.
3. **Interact with the Program**: Follow the on-screen prompts to enter or exit a parking slot.

## Future Enhancements
- **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling for file operations and user input.
- **GUI Integration**: Extend the program with a graphical user interface for easier interaction.
- **Dynamic Slot Management**: Allow dynamic resizing of the number of parking slots.
